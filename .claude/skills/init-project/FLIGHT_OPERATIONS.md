# Flight Operations Quick Reference

> For full methodology docs, see [mission-control](https://github.com/flight-control/mission-control)

## Before You Start

**Read these files in order:**
1. `.flight-ops/ARTIFACTS.md` — Where and how artifacts are stored (project-specific)
2. The **flight log** for your active flight — Ground truth for what happened
3. The **leg artifact** you're implementing — Your acceptance criteria

---

## Three-Agent Workflow

Legs must be implemented by a **separate Developer instance** and reviewed by a **separate Reviewer instance**. Mission Control designs legs and orchestrates — it does NOT implement code directly.

| Instance | Role | Context |
|----------|------|---------|
| Mission Control | Design legs, manage artifacts, orchestrate | Entire flight |
| Developer | Implement code, tests, docs | One leg, then clear |
| Reviewer | Review changes against acceptance criteria | One review, then clear |

The Reviewer has no knowledge of the Developer's reasoning — only the resulting changes. This separation provides objective code review. Use the `/agentic-workflow` skill in mission-control to drive this cycle.

## ⚠️ Leg Completion Checklist (MANDATORY)

**You MUST complete ALL of these before emitting `[COMPLETE:leg]`:**

| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| 1 | All acceptance criteria verified |
| 2 | Tests passing |
| 3 | **Update flight log** — Add leg progress entry (see below) |
| 4 | **Mark leg complete** — Update leg status |
| 5 | **Update flight** — Check off the leg in flight artifact |
| 6 | **Commit/save with all artifact updates** |

**Flight log entry MUST include:**
- Leg status, started date, completed date
- Changes Made (what was implemented)
- Verification (how acceptance criteria were confirmed)
- Any decisions, deviations, or anomalies

Refer to `.flight-ops/ARTIFACTS.md` for exact locations and formats.

## Workflow Signals

Emit at the end of your response, on its own line:

| Signal | When |
|--------|------|
| `[HANDOFF:review-needed]` | Artifact changes ready for validation |
| `[HANDOFF:confirmed]` | Review complete, no issues |
| `[BLOCKED:reason]` | Cannot proceed |
| `[COMPLETE:leg]` | Leg done AND checklist complete |

---

## Implementing a Leg

### Pre-Implementation
1. Read mission, flight, and leg artifacts
2. Read flight log for context from prior legs
3. Verify leg accuracy against existing code
4. Present summary and get approval before proceeding

### Implementation
5. Implement to acceptance criteria
6. Run tests
7. Run code review, fix Critical/Major issues
8. Re-review until clean

### Post-Implementation
9. Propagate changes (project docs, flight artifacts if scope changed)
10. **Complete the Leg Completion Checklist above**
11. Signal `[COMPLETE:leg]`

---

## Just-in-Time Planning

Flights and legs are created one at a time, not upfront.

| Reviewing... | Should exist | Should NOT exist yet |
|--------------|--------------|----------------------|
| Mission | Mission artifact | Flight artifacts (only listed) |
| Flight | Flight artifact | Leg artifacts (only listed) |
| Leg | Leg artifact | Ready to implement |

Listed flights/legs are **tentative suggestions** that evolve based on discoveries.

---

## Reviewing Artifacts

When reviewing a mission, flight, or leg:

1. Read the artifact thoroughly
2. Validate against project goals and existing code
3. Check for ambiguities or missing details
4. Make changes directly if needed
5. Describe any changes made
6. Signal `[HANDOFF:confirmed]` if no issues, or describe changes for validation

---

## Code Review Gate

```
Implement → Test → Review → Fix → Re-review → Complete
```

| Severity | Action |
|----------|--------|
| Critical | Must fix |
| Major | Must fix |
| Minor | Fix if safe, else defer |

Deferred issues go in the flight log.

## ⚠️ Flight Completion Checklist (MANDATORY)

**When you complete the FINAL leg of a flight, also complete these steps:**

| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| 1 | Complete all items in the Leg Completion Checklist above |
| 2 | **Update flight log** — Add flight completion entry with summary |
| 3 | **Update flight status** — Set `**Status**: landed` in flight.md |
| 4 | **Update mission** — Check off this flight in mission.md |
| 5 | **Verify all legs** — Confirm all legs show `completed` status |
| 6 | **Update project docs** — Ensure CLAUDE.md, README, and other docs reflect any new commands, endpoints, configuration, or APIs introduced during the flight |
| 7 | Signal `[COMPLETE:leg]` (the orchestrator will trigger Phase 4) |

The orchestrator will then:
- Mark the PR ready for human review
- Invoke Mission Control for flight debrief

## Database Schema Changes

When a flight modifies database schemas:

1. **Include migration steps in the leg** — schema changes need explicit CREATE/ALTER statements or migration commands
2. **Verify migrations run** — acceptance criteria must include confirming the migration executed successfully against the live database
3. **Update SCHEMA docs** — if the project maintains a SCHEMA reference, update it in the same leg that creates the migration
4. **Test against real DB** — unit tests with mocks are not sufficient for schema changes; verify against the actual database

A table defined in SCHEMA but never created via migration is a gap — treat schema documentation and migration execution as a single atomic operation.

---

## Key Principles

1. **Flight log is ground truth** — Read it first, update it always
2. **Never modify in-progress legs** — Create new ones instead
3. **Binary acceptance criteria** — Met or not met
4. **Log everything** — Decisions, deviations, anomalies
5. **Signal clearly** — End of response, own line
