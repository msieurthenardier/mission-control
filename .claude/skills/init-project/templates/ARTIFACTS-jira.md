# Artifact System: Jira

This project stores Flight Control artifacts as Jira issues.

## Issue Type Mapping

| Flight Control | Jira Issue Type | Hierarchy |
|----------------|-----------------|-----------|
| Mission | Epic | Parent |
| Flight | Story | Child of Epic |
| Leg | Sub-task | Child of Story |

## Setup Questions

Answer these questions when configuring Jira artifacts for your project:

| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| What is the Jira project key? | `PROJECT` |
| JQL query for discovering flight documentation? | (e.g., `project = PROJECT AND labels = flight-control`) |

## Configuration

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Project Key | `PROJECT` |
| Board | (specify board name or ID) |
| Labels | `flight-control` |

---

## Custom Fields

<!-- Add your project's custom Jira fields here -->

| Custom Field | Jira Field ID | Required | Used For | Notes |
|--------------|---------------|----------|----------|-------|
| (example) Team | `customfield_10001` | Yes | All issues | Select from predefined teams |
| (example) Sprint | `customfield_10002` | No | Stories, Sub-tasks | Assign to sprint |

## Project Rules

<!-- Document project-specific Jira rules and conventions here -->

### Required Fields by Issue Type

**Epic (Mission):**
- (list required fields for your project)

**Story (Flight):**
- (list required fields for your project)

**Sub-task (Leg):**
- (list required fields for your project)

### Workflow Rules

- (document any workflow restrictions or automation rules)
- (e.g., "Stories cannot move to In Progress without Epic Link")

### Naming Conventions

- (document any naming patterns required by your project)
- (e.g., "Epic summaries must start with [MISSION]")

## Conventions

- **Naming**: Use clear, action-oriented summaries
- **Linking**: Always link Stories to Epic, Sub-tasks to Story
- **Labels**: Apply `flight-control` label to all artifacts
- **Immutability**: Never modify Sub-tasks once In Progress; create new ones
- **Comments**: Use prefixes (`[Flight Log]`, `[Flight Briefing]`, etc.) for filtering
